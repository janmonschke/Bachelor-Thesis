### USER EXPERIENCE 
But talking about speed in the context of user-experience means more than just performance of client-server communication (http://code.google.com/intl/de/speed/articles/usability-latency.html). Say you have a website that does heavy calculations for the user. SPWAs won't perform better in calculations on the server side than normal websites. But one weakness of normal web pages is that there won't be a feedback that tells the user that it takes a longer time to generate the next page other than a long break until the next page has loaded completely. In SPWAs, loading indicators like labels (e.g. "Loading...") or spinning animations are used to give the user an immediate feedback on an action that may take longer. This won't speed up the calculation but it shows the user that the system has registered the input and that the user has to wait. This also prevents users from clicking the same link again which may even lead to longer response times.
