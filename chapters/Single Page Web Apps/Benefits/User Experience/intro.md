### USER EXPERIENCE 
Talking about speed in the context of user-experience means more than just performance of client-server communication (http://code.google.com/intl/de/speed/articles/usability-latency.html). When a website does heavy calculations for the user SPWAs won't perform better in calculating the result on the server-side than normal websites. But one weakness of normal websites is that there is no feedback telling the user that a certain operation may take longer. The screen will stay blank or will not change for a long time.
In SPWAs, loading indicators like labels (e.g. "Loading...") or spinning animations are used to give the user an immediate feedback on an action that may take longer. This won't speed up the calculation but it shows the user that the system has registered the input and that the user has to wait. This also prevents users from clicking the same link again, which may even lead to longer response times.
