### Sound
Another neat feature that SPWAs offer is that they allow websites to have music playing permanently in the background without stopping when the page changes.
Currently most websites that let users play music suffer from the page-reload problem and don't allow the user to simultaneously browse the page and listen to the music (e.g. http://www.last.fm, http://www.soundcloud.com). Users have to keep at least two tabs/windows of these pages open.
Other websites bypass this problem by opening a dedicated new window only for the music player (e.g. http://www.jamendo.com, http://www.play.fm). Both solutions suffer from the same problem: it is very cumbersome for the user to control the player.
The user has to switch the tab / window or even, when the user has to many tabs / windows open, the user has to search for the player. 
Stopping the player or altering the volume can take quite a while and this delay leads to a bad user experience. In SPWAs the player can simply get embedded into the page and it will always remain on the same position so that users can easily control it. Of course the player won't stop playing when another page is requested since the reload does not affect the player.
A good example for the use of SPWAs in a music-context is simfy (http://www.simfy.de)[add screenshot, maybe with comparison to other sites mentioned above]. The player is fixed at the bottom of the page and it remains there when the content of the page changes. To not get in the way while browsing, the player's size is adjustable.
