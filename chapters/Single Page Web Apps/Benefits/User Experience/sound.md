### Sound
Furthermore a not so important but maybe pretty neat feature that SPWAs offer is that they allow you to have music play in the background without stopping when the page changes. Currently most websites that let users play music either suffer from this problem and don't allow the user to simultaneously browse the page and listen to the music they offer (e.g. http://www.last.fm, http://www.soundcloud.com) so that users have to keep at least two tabs/windows of these pages open or websites bypass this problem by opening a dedicated new window only for the player (e.g. http://www.jamendo.com, http://www.play.fm). Both solutions suffer from the same problem: it is very cumbersome for the user to control the player. The user has to switch the tab / window or even, when the user has to many tabs / windows open, search for the player. Stopping the player or altering the volume can take quite a while and this delay leads to a bad user experience. With SPWAs you can simply embed the player into the page and it will always remain on the same position so that users can easily control it. A good example for the use of SPWAs in a music-context is simfy (http://www.simfy.de)[add screenshot, maybe with comparison to other sites mentioned above]. The player is fixed at the bottom of the page and it remains there when the content of the page changes. To not get in the way while browsing the page, the player has an adjustable size.
