### Transitions
Another benefit SPWAs have over normal web pages is that it is possible to have transitions / animations between page changes.
Animations / Transitions are more and more often used in modern web pages to make them feel more dynamic and to make the user have more fun using the page. But a reload on a normal website will break the dynamic impression because the page will simply turn blank on page change until the new page is loaded. To make the user-experience on a website consistent one could add page transitions like they are implemented in the salon canvas views. All images will fade-out and fade-in when navigating through the different pages and user overviews. This makes the navigation feel a lot smoother and it also hides loading times (both from the server request and each image) from the user. 
- mention apple.com: good try, nice fading front page but changing a page leads to staggering impression
- mention: users may not actively see that something changed, but it will feel better: salon fade-in fade-out
