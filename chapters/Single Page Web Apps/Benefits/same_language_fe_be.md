### SAME LANGUAGE IN FRONTEND AND BACKEND
Server-side JavaScript has become very popular recently with the development of node.js, an event-driven server that allows developers to write all their backend code in JavaScript. Its event-based programming paradigm, I/O operations won't block the server until they're finished, instead an event is fired when data is available, allows the server to handle way more concurrent request than other (blocking) server technologies. This makes this technology very interesting for high-traffic websites.
Dealing with the same language on both end-points means that developers can share code, for example model-logic, to reduce code duplication and unwanted double-maintenance. This can lead to a faster and more efficient development and developers don't need to change the way they program since it is the same syntax in the frontend and in the backend.
