### Speed / Efficiency
The most important benefit of SPWAs is that they'll speed up your website performance. Even more: They make the client-server communication more efficient. Speed comes with less data being sent to the clients and less time that is needed by the server to render complex views. Efficiency is very important e.g. when you know that a lot of your clients connect via slower networks or when your server will have to handle a lot requests per second. 
The faster a website reacts on user input or the faster it loads, the better is its user experience. There are a lot of studies that investigated the impact of a website's speed to its user experience and they all support the thesis mentioned above. For example in 2009, Forrester Consulting conducted a study to investigate the behavior of online shoppers (http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2009/press_091409.html). They found out that a page should not take longer than 2 seconds to load or otherwise the user becomes unsatisfied and eventually will stop using the online shop or even switch to another competitor. 52% of the interviewees mentioned in the poll, that page speed is one of the most important features for a good online shop. 
When Google intentionally slowed down their search results in one of their public experiments (http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/speed-matters.html), they observed a decline of the total number of searches by 0.2% to 0.6%. The more delay they added to the results, the lesser searches would be made by a user. By regarding how short delays Google added to the searches (first 100ms, later up to 400ms) this experiment shows very well how important each millisecond delay can be for the overall user experience on a website.
The simple and efficient design of client-server communication in SPWAs makes them very fast so that the wait time for users is reduced to a minimum
