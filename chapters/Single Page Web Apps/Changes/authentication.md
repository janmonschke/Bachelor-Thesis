### AUTHENTICATION
Authentication is something that still has to be done on the server-side. But enabling authentication in your web app is a not so trivial task. State-of-the-art authentication systems like Devise are developed to get as easily integrated into your web page as possible. Therefore they offer view-partials for all athentication actions (sign up, log in etc.) that you can integrate in your layout files and they will work out of the box. But you can’t use these views in a single page web app and you have to rewrite them and the corresponding controllers to enable authentication via AJAX. Rewriting most of the controller code can take a long time and one should, before starting to develop, very well decide on the authentication system one is going to use. If there’s no good authentication solution available one could also [verlagern] all authentication actions to the server and let him render the forms. In this way you can use all authentication systems in the market and you don’t have to worry about AJAX authentication. The only problem with this solution is that you have to also provide a server-side layout to let your authentication pages look like the rest of your application. But the effort in maintaining a second layout file is nothing compared to rewriting the controllers especially when you need to upgrade the authentication system and there were changes that make your controllers malfunction.
