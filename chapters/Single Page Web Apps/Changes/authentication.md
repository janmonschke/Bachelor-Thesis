### AUTHENTICATION
State-of-the-art authentication systems are designed to get as easily integrated into a website as possible. Therefore they automatically create views for all authentication actions (sign-up, log-in etc.) that then can get integrated in layout files.
But since in SPWAs the backend views cannot be used, the authentication systems have to get adjusted to support the authentication over AJAX requests. The complexity of these adjustments depend on the modularity and open-ness of the authentication-systems.
If it is not possible to make changes to the authentication system to support AJAX authentication, for example because it's a closed-source project, the complete authentication part could get moved back to the server-side. This means that all forms that are used for authentication could get served as normal websites instead of client-side views. In this way, all authentication systems in the market could get used.
But a problem of this solution is that there has to be an implementation of the website's layout on the server-side and on the client-side so that all authentication pages look like the rest of the website. This means that layout files have to get maintained in both systems.
