### Forms
One of the things that speed up the development enormously when working with a backend framework are form helpers. They allow you to rapidly create forms for CRUD operations on models without having to write much code. Again these helpers don't work in SPWAs since they generate forms in the backend and create HTML that is used in backend templating engines.
Writing all forms without these helpers would lead to a lot of duplicated code that is needed for the AJAX requests and the error handling. So one of the most important tools that have been written with the development of Salon is a client-side form-helper that allows developers to quickly create forms that automatically take care of client-server communication. The helper is capable of pre-fill forms with a model's attributes, provides hooks to allow a developer to override the default behavior (e.g. AJAX calls) and automatically displays errors when a user has entered wrong values.
