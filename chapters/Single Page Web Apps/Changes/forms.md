### Forms
One of the things that enormously speed up the development when working with a backend framework are form-helpers. They allow developers to rapidly create forms for CRUD [explanation, CREATE;RETRIEVE;UPDATE;DELETE] operations on models without having to write much code. Again, these helpers don't work in SPWAs since they generate forms in the backend and create HTML that is used in backend templating-engines.
Writing all forms without such helpers would lead to a lot of duplicated code that is needed for the AJAX requests and the error handling and it is also very time consuming having to write forms from scratch each time. To avoid the unnecessary time consumption and the duplicate code a client-side form-helper has been developed during the development of Salon. The component works well together with the model base classes that have been provided by the already mentioned Backbone.js (see XX) and automatically takes care of the server communication and validations. The form-helper is additionally capable of pre-filling forms with a model's attributes, it provides hooks to allow developers to override the default behavior (e.g. AJAX calls) and it automatically displays error messages when a user has entered wrong values.
