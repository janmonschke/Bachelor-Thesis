### INTERNATIONALIZATION
By moving all views to the front-end you also have to move all internationalization (i18n) logic to the front-end. I18n systems in modern web application systems are very well integrated in the View layer because thatâ€™s where their functionality is mainly needed. But since now in SPWAs all Views are rendered on the front-end we can no longer use the back-end i18n system. There are various i18n implemented in JavaScript but I wanted to have a system that has the same API as the i18n implementation of Ruby on Rails so that all my old templates could be used without having to change them. It should not just have the same API as the RoR i18n system but also it should have the same format for translation files which in RoR's case is YAML (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) so that I also should not have to rewrite existing translation files.
My implementation of the RoR i18n system supports the normal and the shorthand calls ("translate PARAMS", "t PARAMS") as well as the string access notation for the specific translations (e.g. "user.create.success"). It can be used as a full replacement for the RoR system. Other than the RoR system one needs to specifically import the translation files on the first load, they won't get loaded on default.
