### INTERNATIONALIZATION
By moving all views to the front-end, also the internationalization (i18n) logic has to move to the frontend. I18n systems in modern web application are very well integrated in the view layer because thatâ€™s where their functionality is primarily needed. But since in SPWAs all views are rendered in the frontend these systems can no longer be used.
There are various i18n systems implemented in JavaScript and they have already proven to work good but they all have a very different API to normal i18n systems so that developers would need to first learn a new API before they could use it. Because of this Salon uses an own i18n system that adopts the API of the Rails i18n system and is therefore easy to use for developers that have already worked with Rails or other backend frameworks.
One disadvantage of client-side i18n systems is that all languages have to get loaded in the initial page request to have a smooth and quick language-change. When it is not important to have a new language to load immediately, the translations files could also be loaded when they are needed. Mostly the language is not so often changed by a user, which means that loading the language files only when they are needed seems like a valid method.
