### NOTIFICATIONS
Many backend frameworks give developers a simple way to display so called flash messages. Messages that should be displayed once a  request has been finished and the page has been rendered, like "Successfully deleted this item". The purpose of these messages is to give the user a feedback to his action because maybe the user just got redirected and the message should remind him that he got redirected because he deleted the page that he was on or maybe the message should show him that the system has successfully finished his task but the page that he is on doesn't give any visual feedback that something changed e.g. "Settings saved successfully". A backend framework would provide these messages to the view layer where the message normally is being rendered into a DOM element in the layout.
This technique doesn't work for SPWAs since the backend doesn't render parts of the view so I wrote an own notification system. The system adds the flash messages to the JSON response and a client-side notification component, that listens for all incoming AJAX responses, parses the message and displays it accordingly (distinguishes between success and error messages). Notifications and status indicators are very important for SPWAs and other AJAX-heavy websites because there is no reload of the page that tells the user that something is happening on the page. AJAX requests may take a long time so one should always give the user an immediate visual feedback of any kind that the site has registered his action. And since in most cases only parts of the website change there should be notification that tell the user what just has happened because he may not notice minimal changes in the page layout.
