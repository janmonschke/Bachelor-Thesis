### RENDERING VIEWS
A common technique to render views in the backend is to use an abstraction layer called "templating-engine". These engines allow writing the views in a mostly HTML-like syntax to improve readability and maintainability over manual string-concatenations in the backend language. Also the syntax makes it easy for designers to create and edit templates on their own, rather than having a backend developer who always needs to implement all changes.
A templating-engine pre-compiles views into functions or string-concatenations so that the backend can execute them faster and doesnâ€™t need to interpret them at runtime. The pre-compiled functions are mostly automatically generated and developers generally don't need to work in these files.
In Single Page Web Apps the templating-engine resides on the client-side (see Fig. X). To reduce bandwidth, the backend only sends raw data to the clients (in a transportation format like JSON) that can very rapidly get serialized.
The template-engine in the frontend then renders HTML snippets from the data and inserts them into the DOM.
There are several JavaScript implementations of the most used backend templating-engines and they can all compete with their backend implementations when it comes to speed and flexibility.
