### URLS
Since browsers automatically handle hyperlinks with a GET-request, the URLs in SPWAs look different to normal URLs. They make use of the "#"-symbol that originally was used as an anchor to an element in a HTML page. This is needed on pages like Wikipedia where you have long text articles on one page and you want to point the user to a specific paragraph. The browser's viewport automatically jumps to the element with the given ID if there is one.
To prevent the GET-request, a client-side router listens to changes in the URL after the "#"-symbol. [There is no real way to "listen" to changes in the meaning of event-driven programming. This is mostly implemented with polling.] When it changed the router typically triggers a handler for the new URL-partial. So when the URL before was "mydomain.tld/#index" and it has been changed to "mydomain.tld/#about", the URL-router will trigger a handler that has registered for the "about" partial. This also makes all URLs bookmarkable since the router will render the corresponding views to each URL-partial no matter what page has been displayed before (even on the initial request).
