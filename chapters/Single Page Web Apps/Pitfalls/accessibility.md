### Accessibility
SPWAs only work when clients have JavaScript enabled and this makes them useless for users that either have disabled JavaScript on purpose to increase the browser performance (link to NoScript extension) or users that are browsing at work that are not allowed to have their browsers to execute JavaScript. According to statistics by Yahoo (http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/how-many-users-have-javascript-disabled) the percentage of users that have disabled JavaScript is approximately 1%. That number may seem low but if a page has one million page visits a month ten thousand of them are not able to use the page. There is the possibility to display a message that demands the user to activate JavaScript with the noscript-tag (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html#h-18.3.1) but users that have actively disabled JavaScript did this for a reason and may simply decide not to use the site. One has to be aware of these numbers when creating JavaScript-heavy applications.
