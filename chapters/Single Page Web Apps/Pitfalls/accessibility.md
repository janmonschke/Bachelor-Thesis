### Accessibility
SPWAs only work when clients have JavaScript enabled and this makes them useless for users that either have disabled JavaScript on purpose to increase the browser performance (link to NoScript extension) or users that are browsing at work that are not allowed to have their browsers to execute JavaScript. According to statistics by Yahoo (http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/how-many-users-have-javascript-disabled) the percentage of users that have disabled JavaScript is approximately 1%. That number may seem low but if a page has one million page visits a month ten thousand of them are not able to use the page. There is the possibility to display a message that demands the user to activate JavaScript with the noscript-tag (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html#h-18.3.1) but users that have actively disabled JavaScript did this for a reason and may simply decide not to use the site. One has to be aware of these numbers when creating JavaScript-heavy applications.
Another problem with dynamically generated layouts is that it is hard for screen readers to semantically interpret these layouts. Although 75% of screen reader users have JavaScript enabled (http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey2/#javascript) the screen readers are not able to properly interpret dynamic DOM changes that are used to "switch" pages in SPWAs. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), an organization that creates recommendations for web developers to make the web more accessible, is aware of the problems described above and created a guideline called "WAI-ARIA"(http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php) that should provide solutions to developers and it is expected to get published in the middle of 2011.
