### Accessibility
SPWAs only work when clients have JavaScript enabled and this makes them useless for users that either have disabled JavaScript on purpose, e.g. to increase the browser performance, or users that are browsing at work and that are not allowed to have their browsers execute JavaScript.
According to statistics by Yahoo (http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/how-many-users-have-javascript-disabled) the percentage of users that have disabled JavaScript is approximately 1%. That number may seem low at first but it means that if a page has one million page visits a month, ten thousand of them are not able to use the page.
There is the possibility to display a message that demands the user to activate JavaScript with the noscript-tag in HTML (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html#h-18.3.1), but users that have actively disabled JavaScript did this for a reason and may simply decide not to use the site. Developers have to be aware of the numbers mentioned above when creating JavaScript-heavy applications.
Another problem with dynamically generated layouts is that it is hard for screen readers to semantically interpret these layouts. Although 75% of screen reader users have JavaScript enabled (http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey2/#javascript), the screen readers are not able to properly interpret dynamic DOM changes that are used to "switch" pages in SPWAs.
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), an organization that creates recommendations for web developers to make websites more accessible, is aware of the problems described above and created a guideline called "WAI-ARIA"(http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php) that aims to provide solutions to developers and its publication is expected for the middle of 2011. The current working draft (http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-implementation) describes a set of additional events that should get fired for example when a when a DOM element's text-content changes or an element is being hidden. These events are processed by the screen reader to create a semantically correct feedback for the user.
