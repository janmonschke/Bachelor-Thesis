### Business Logic / Sensitive Data
Moving the complete business-logic to the client-side means that every user that knows how to display the source of a website can easily see how a website / a business works. Modern browsers even further have integrated tools that allow users to deeply inspect a website's code and to especially monitor AJAX requests. The problem that users can cheat on a website's code is not a problem that only occurs in SPWAs, generally a problem of every website, but since almost all business-logic resides in the user's browser this problem has a much bigger impact on SPWAs. When a website deals with sensitive data (bank accounts, credit card numbers...) developers need to make sure that none of the code on the front-end exposes security holes that could harm the website's users. Generally all privacy relevant operations should be done on the server-side and to secure the client-server communication HTTPS should be used instead of normal HTTP.
Another important thing is to double-check login-states and admin-rights on the server and don't let only the client-side handle it. Assume the following scenario: An app has a global user object with a boolean field called "admin". The app displays editable elements according to the value of the admin field in the user object. A user could now simply open up the JavaScript console of his browser and change the value of the admin field to get access to all editable elements.
A way to protect websites from this attack is to add a server-side generated field in the responses that adds information on the rights of the current user. The app then switches the editable elements according to the response rather than according to a front-end object that could have been edited by a user. But still the backend should always double-check the user's rights on incoming requests.
Another method to secure a website's code is to obfuscate it before it gets deployed to the server. In that way the code is not as readable as before and attackers would need to put a lot more effort in understanding the obfuscated code code to harm a website. A nice side-effect that usually comes with code-obfuscation in JavaScript is that the code also gets compressed so not only the website gets secured but also the load time gets reduced.
