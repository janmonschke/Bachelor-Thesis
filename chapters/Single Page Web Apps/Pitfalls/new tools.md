### New Tools needed
When you want to create a normal web application there are tons of frameworks and tools that help you throughout the whole development, deployment and maintenance process. These tools have been optimized over the past years and developers have learnt how to become most productive with these tools.
There are no such integrated tools and frameworks for SPWAs yet. There are tools that fit one specific part of the process like compiling the Views (Eco) or giving you a MVC structure in your app (backbonejs) but as a developer you have to connect these tools manually which can be quite time consuming. For the backend you still can use the old tools but they won't help you very much for your client-side development. New tools have to get developed so you don't have to struggle with your development environment on every new project and can clearly focus on working on the project.
A first step for new tools has been made with brunch [https://github.com/brunch/brunch], a tool-chain that combines all the needed technologies on your client-side into one command line call. This very much helps to speed up the development on your SPWA but you still have to develop your back-end with another tool because brunch currently is backend agnostic and doesn't provide any backend helpers. To ease development even more there is definitely the need for tools that also help with your backend.
