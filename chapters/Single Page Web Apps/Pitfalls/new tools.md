### New Tools needed
When working on a normal web application there are tons of frameworks and tools that help throughout the whole development-, deployment- and maintenance process. These tools have been optimized over the past years and developers have learnt how to become most productive with these tools.
Such integrated tools and frameworks don't exist for SPWAs yet. There are tools that fit one specific part of the process like compiling the Views or giving the app a MVC structure, but developers have to connect these tools manually. In the backend the old tools can still get used but they don't support the client-side development that much. New tools have to get developed so that developers don't have to struggle with their development environment on every new project and can clearly focus on working on the project.
A first step for new tools has been made with brunch [https://github.com/brunch/brunch], a tool-chain that combines all the needed technologies for the client-side development into one command line call. This very much helps to speed up the development on SPWAs but developers still have to develop the back-end with another tool because brunch currently is backend-agnostic and doesn't provide any backend helpers. To ease development even more there is definitely the need for tools that support the development in the frontend as well as in the backend.
