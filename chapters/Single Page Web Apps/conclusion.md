### CONCLUSION

SPWAs really can help to make a website feel better, to give the user a better experience browsing it. They allow a lot of new interaction concepts and more dynamic sites than we have today. AJAX was a first step to make websites feel more fluid but SPWAs bring the whole concept to a next level by giving the ability to get a completely fluid navigation and transition system. There now is the possibility to create websites that don't look and feel like normal websites and actually are fun to wrk with.
The concept has already been taken over by big companies like Google (Google Mail Chat / Client-side routing) or Facebook (Facebook Chat / Facebook Messages / Content is replaced inline, no new request) and others to make parts of their website more dynamic and I think that there will be more and more pages that take over the technique. 
In my opinion the rise in the interest for Node.js will also result in more and more companies switching to the SPWA idiom not just because of its positive impact on the User Experience but also because of the ability to share code between client and server. And since there are (currently) no big web frameworks like RoR for Node.js developers it may be easier and faster for developers use tools like brunch to program websites with a simple REST-based Node.js backend.
But one also has to admit that SPWA brings a lot of new tools and technologies with it and so it might in a first run not be faster o develop because the programmers need to learn the new tools. Especially when developers don't have experience in programming in JavaScript the learning process can take a while because of the asynchronous parts that you have to deal with in JavaScript.
Before developing a SPWA one should first think about the negative points above and decide if it's okay to not get ranked in search engines currently (without extra effort) or if it's okay to expose the business logic to the user. Only if you don't think that these negative impacts will harm the success of your website you can start building the app.
If you decide to port an already running and established website you should think twice about switching because your page may already be well indexed in the major search engines and all links may lead to a dead end after the rewrite of your page (if you don't have a redirect component) like it happened to gawker.com, a well established "media news and gossip" blog [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker], that switched the whole blog to a SPWA in February of 2011 and all indexed links were broken so that the number of unique visitors dropped by 50% [http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/17/gawker-redesign/] and a lot of users wrote bad reviews about the page.
In conclusion there is no single answer if a website should be implemented as a SPWA. It always depends on the website's focus. If the website has to meet the requirements of the WCAG [add explanations] then it would be easier to realize the website as a normal website because it is hard to make SPWAs accessible as shown in [Accessibility]. But when it is important for a website to have a good User Experience and the User Experience is more important than a good ranking in several search engines (those that don't index SPWAs) then the implementation of the website as a SPWA is right decision.
