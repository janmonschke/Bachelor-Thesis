### SPWA intro
In the beginning Salon was a normal Ruby on Rails application. All views were rendered on the server and a lot of JavaScript code was needed to make the UI as flexible as it is now. The JavaScript code was structured with the help of Backbone.js  a JavaScript library that gives you Models, Views and Controllers and lets you write event-driven frontend-code. Quickly I found out that I often was rewriting backend code on the client side in JavaScript, especially when it came to rendering Views. To dynamically create images and to display them I created a JavaScript template that looked the same as the ruby template. Also I rewrote parts of the Model logic to enable an easier communication with the backend. More and more of the application logic moved to the client side and I decided to rewrite Salon as a single Page web app because I didnâ€™t want to have to maintain application logic on the server and on the frontend.
SINGLE PAGE WEB APPS
Single Page Web Apps gained a lot of attention with JavaScript becoming more and more important in web development. The AJAX technology is a main reason for this development because on-site DOM manipulation could only be done with JavaScript in the most browsers. Single Page Web Apps take this approach to a next level by shifting a lot of traditional backend functions to the frontend. In the following I will point out the main differences between the traditional (MVC-based) Web App system and Single Page Web Apps by analyzing a typical request flow in both systems.
