### SPWA intro
In the beginning Salon was a standard Ruby on Rails application. All views were rendered on the server and a lot of JavaScript code was needed to make the UI as flexible as it is now. The JavaScript code was structured with the help of Backbone.js(http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) a JavaScript library that gives you Models, Views and Controllers and lets you write event-driven frontend-code. Quickly that lead to duplicated code that needed to get implemented in the backend language and in the frontend language. An example: In order to dynamically create images in the page overview, a JavaScript template was used that looked the same as the ruby template. Also parts of the Model have been rewritten logic to enable an easier communication with the backend. More and more of the application logic moved to the client-side and so I decided to rewrite Salon as a Single Page Web App because I didnâ€™t want to have to maintain application logic on the backend and on the frontend at the same time and because I wanted to profit form the other advantages that Single Page Web Apps offer over normal websites.

SINGLE PAGE WEB APPS
Single Page Web Apps gained a lot of attention with JavaScript becoming more and more important in the web development tool chain. The AJAX technology is a main reason for this development because on-site DOM manipulation could only be done with JavaScript in the most browsers. Single Page Web Apps take this approach to a next level by shifting a lot of traditional backend functions to the frontend. In the following I will point out the main differences between the traditional (MVC-based) Web App system and Single Page Web Apps by analyzing a typical request flow in both systems.
