### REQUEST FLOW COMPARISON

## TRADITIONAL
When a new page is requested, the user's browser sends an HTTP request to the server. This request is then matched to the corresponding controller by a router. The controller then triggers the model-layer to retrieve the necessary data for the request from the underlying database. When the data has been successfully fetched, the controller triggers the view-layer to render the data into the requested view. Views may be constructed from several sub-views that are rendered into one layout file. The rendered layout is then transferred back to the browser.
The browser completely removes the old DOM and re-renders a new DOM from the layout that just has been transferred. This leads to the typical blank screen in the browser when a new page is being requested.

## SINGLE PAGE
The Single Page request-flow is initialized by a "#-change" of the current URL, rather than by a normal URL change (see chapter URL). This change triggers a client-side Router to call a certain Controller function that initializes an AJAX request instead of a synchronous HTTP request.
Then the Single Page request-flow is the same as the traditional request-flow but the backend system won't render a HTML view from the data. Instead of letting the server render a complete new layout and transfer it to the client, the data gets serialized into a transport format (e.g. JSON or XML). The frontend framework takes care of rendering a view from the data. Now instead of replacing the whole DOM, the generated view replaces only a part of the page (e.g. the content panel). This prevents the screen from turning blank when the new content is being displayed.
Another difference in the request flow is that in SPWAs the initial request (e.g. "www.mydomain.tld") delivers a complete web app, with all the application-logic in it, and not just a snapshot of it. When the initial page has been loaded, a fronted-router takes care of rendering the correct JavaScript views.
