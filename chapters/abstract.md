### Abstract
The Internet has become a medium that is used by more and more people on a daily basis. In the beginning websites used to be static HTML pages whose only purpose was to provide information to the users. The image of websites has changed a lot recently and websites are now more than just accumulations of information. Websites have become a lot more interactive and content is very often not just created by dedicated authors but by the users themselves. Although the usage of websites has changed over the time, the development of websites still is similar to the development in the beginning. Most work is done on servers and clients are mainly needed to display HTML. This architecture complicates the development of highly interactive websites.
Single Page Web Apps is a novel architectural style that let's developers write interactive websites in a more integrated and efficient way. Their approach is to assign more duties, that have been typically placed in the backend in traditional websites, to the frontend.
This work will describe an implementation of a website that has been developed as a Single Page Web App to create a unique interactive User Experience and it will furthermore give an in-depth description and discussion of Single Page Web Apps in general.
