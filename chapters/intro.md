## Salon intro

### The idea
The basic idea behind Salon was developed by Sebastian Deutsch and Stefan Landrock when they were given the chance to take over university curses at the HFG in Offenbach. Together with the students they built a working prototype of it so they could use it for their curses and especially for their presentations. When other universities heard about Salon they asked Stefan and Sebastian if they could host a system for their students too. But Salon was not built to be deployable for other universities and they asked me if I could re-build and to [erweitern] Salon to have a clean code-base and a portable system so that it could easily be deployed and changed [anderes wort für verändert] for other universities.

### What is Salon? Overview
Salon basically is a web-based system that allows registered users to create Pages and to upload Images onto these pages. On a first sight this functionality may not look very innovative since there are millions of services on the internet that allow the user to upload images. The main improvement that Salon offers that other services don't offer is that registered users are able to fully control how the images are being presented to visitors. All images are placed on a canvas and can freely be dragged around by the user. Also the canvas itself can be dragged. This feature gives the presenter another way to express the meaning of the images. Dragging the images is not the only way to personalize pages but we will come to this at a later point.
