## Salon intro

### What is Salon?

### The idea
The basic idea behind Salon was developed by Sebastian Deutsch and Stefan Landrock when they were given the chance to take over university curses at the HFG in Offenbach. Together with the students they built a working prototype of it so they could use it for their curses and especially for their presentations.
