## Salon intro

### What is Salon? Overview
Salon is a web-based platform that allows its users to create pages and to upload images onto these pages to create an online portfolio of their work. The main target audience is photographers, illustrators and graphic designers. The platform focuses on a unique way in both presenting and arranging sets of images. The user is able to fully control the way the images are presented to the visitors.
Other services, like for example Flickr, don't let users decide about the presentation of their work and only provide simple list views and slide shows. On these websites all albums look the same because the raster is always predefined.
In Salon all images are placed on a canvas and can freely get dragged around by the user to create innovative and unique arrangements. Also the canvas itself can be moved to focus a certain point of a page. Another feature is that images can link to other pages so that users can create associations between pages or even associations between users.
These features give the user another way to express his creativity and make Salon stand out from all competing websites.

### The idea
Dipl. Inf. Sebastian Deutsch and Dipl. Des. Stefan Landrock developed the basic idea behind Salon when they were guest-lecturing courses at the HFG Offenbach. Together with their students they built a working prototype of their idea so they could use it for their courses and especially for their presentations. When other universities heard about Salon they were asked if they could host a system for their students too. But Salon was not built to be deployable for other universities and so they had the idea to rewrite and to extend the features of Salon so that it could easily be set up for other universities.
