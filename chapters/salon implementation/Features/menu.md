### MENU
The menu is consistently placed in the top right corner of the page and is by default not expanded so that it doesn't unnecessarily take away screen space. To expand the menu the user simply needs to hover over it with his mouse or, if he is navigation with a touch enabled device, tap it. There are two states the menu could be in: a) The User is logged in, b) The user is not logged in.
When the user is not logged in the menu will have the caption "Sign in/up" which stands for the two most important options that are displayed in the expanded menu. The first point in the menu (see Fig. XX) will lead the user to the sign-in form and the second point to the sign-up form. The third point will lead to the about page, which explains the concept of Salon, and the fourth point will lead the user to the index page. The latter points will remain at the least position in both menu states.
