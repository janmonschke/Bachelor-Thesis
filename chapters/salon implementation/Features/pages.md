### Pages

## Page overview
At first sight the page overview looks similar to the user overview. The images can freely get dragged around and the title of each image is displayed when the image is hovered. Also the user is navigated to the image page when he clicks the image or one of the captions.
Besides that, there are subtle changes to some of the images. They have special icons that should indicate that they don't link to the image page but to an external page (see Fig.YY e.g. http://google.com) or to an internal page, meaning another page overview of this user (e.g. test). (More on cross-references of images in Image#edit[])
Also there is another icon directly underneath the icon that allows the user to quickly jump to edit form of this current page.
