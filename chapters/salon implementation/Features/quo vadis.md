### Quo vadis / upcoming features
The development of Salon should not stop after finishing this thesis and there are various additional features planned for the future.

## Remix-me
The "Remix-me" feature would allow a user to clone an existing page from another user and then to edit it as if it was one of his pages. These remixes would then get listed on the original page and a caption would get added to pages that are remixes so that the original authors would always be mentioned. This feature should be an optional feature for pages and should need an activation in the page edit form for each page to preserve copyrights of the original content.
A scenario could be that profs create pages to specific topics and then make an exercise in class that students should remix the current page and add their own ideas to the page. This creates the question whether it should be allowed to the remixer to delete images from the original author.
Overall this feature could boost interaction between users and create an element that is fun to use.

## More Assets
Currently there is only one asset type that can get added to pages: the image. But the backend design allows to easily add other sorts of assets for example text assets or sound files. Especially the combination of text assets and image assets could lead to a lot of interesting pages. Texts could link to other pages or they could serve as a description for images.

## Animations
To improve the user experience, more animations could get added to Salon. For example when navigation through the images of a page with the keys, the images could slide-in from the side instead of just suddenly appearing after a key has been pressed.
Or a more complex animation: When selecting a page on a user's overview, all other images could fade out. After all other images have been faded out and the new data for the page overview has been fetched, the new images for the page are placed behind and under the current image. They would then simultaneously fade in and get smoothly moved to their positions while the cover image fades out.
An advantage that comes with this animation is that users are able to see where all the images are placed, even those that would not be visible from the beginning. But this animation could distract the user's attention from what is really important on each page: the images and their arrangement.
  
## Zoom
Pages with a lot of images tend to look cluttered and then images often are dragged out of the visible area of the canvas. Sometimes this leads to accidentally hiding certain images and the users will not notice that there are more images on the page. A zoom feature that lets users zoom in and out of overview pages would help to give users an overview of pages with a lot of content and could also be another element for users to experiment with (e.g. by hiding images that can only be seen when a user completely zooms out of the page.)
