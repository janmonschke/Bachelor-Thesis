### Search
The search field is located inside the navigation to allow the user to quickly search for images on any page. When typing into the field the system automatically starts a search for matching tags and provides the user with drop-down list of tags. By hitting the "enter" key or by choosing one of the items from the list the user gets redirected to the search result page. Here all images that match the tag search will be displayed and a click on them will navigate the user to the corresponding page of the image.
A scenario for the search could be that a prof wants to find all images and its pages that students have put online to solve an exercise and students had to tag their images with a specific tag. Also a tag search can be used by students to get inspiration by searching for images on a specific topic.
