### Page Index
The page index is a list of all the pages the current user owns and it is the page a user is forwarded to after the login.
Each entry in the list stands for one of the user's pages and gives the user an overview on some facts about this page like the current cover image and the number of images stored in it, as well as the name of each page. Furthermore, the page offers the user the ability to quickly delete pages and the ability to directly go to the edit form for each page.
In comparison to the user overview where the user also is able to delete and edit pages, this page also shows all pages that have a status of "hidden" or "not published".
Pages basically can have three states: 
1) "published": This page is shown in the user's page overview. 
2) "hidden": This page is invisible and not accessible for other users.
3) "not published": This page will not be shown in the user's overview but it is accessible for other users that know the URL.
The "not published"-state is useful when a user is currently working on a page but he wants to show the page to others to get a feedback but he does not want to have this page appear in his public overview. To change the publish state, a user simply has to choose the new state from the drop-down list and the page automatically gets updated.
