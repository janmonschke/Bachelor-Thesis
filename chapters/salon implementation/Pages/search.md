### Search
The search field is located inside the navigation to allow the user to quickly search for images on any page. When typing into the field, the system automatically starts a search for matching tags and provides the user with drop-down. By hitting the "enter" key or by choosing one of the items from the list the user gets redirected to the search result page.
Here all images that match the search term will get displayed and a click on them will navigate the user to the corresponding page. A scenario for the search could be that a prof wants to find all images and the associated pages that his students have put online for an exercise. Students could tag their images with a specific tag so that the prof can find them by searching for it. Also a tag search can be used by students to get inspiration by searching for images on a specific topic.
