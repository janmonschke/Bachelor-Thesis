### evaluation
In conclusion it can be said that the implementation of Salon went very well and that all features that were available in the prototype are also available in this implementation. This implementation even contains more features than the prototype.
Each page and each image now has a dedicated form to edit its properties, images can have several link targets and the whole website has been implemented as a SPWA which brings a lot advantages in User Experience. Also an own Drag&Drop-system has been written to better match the Salon requirements (more lightweight, (multi) touch-support).
The clean and well-structured code base makes it easy to make changes to the system when universities or customers want to change a behavior or if they want to remove a certain feature. Since Salon is a SPWA with a Rails backend it is also very easy to deploy instances of it to the Internet or a university intranet. 
The overall User Experience and the unique Drag&Drop-portfolio concept make Salon a website that is fun to use both for users that create content and for users that browse the page.
