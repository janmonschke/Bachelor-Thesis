### Model structure
The underlying data structure of Salon is rather simple. There are users that are used for authentication and have basic properties like a username and a password. Pages are associated to users in a one to many relationship which means that users can have as many pages as they want and each page belongs to only one user. Pages have properties like a title, a cover image and a publish state. Each page has a list of assets that are also associated in a one to many relationship so that each asset can be associated to one page. Asset is the parent class for image and it stores properties like a title, a link-to location and a position on the canvas.
The reason for deriving image from asset is to allow other assets like for example texts in the future (see salon#quovadis) and to provide all derivations with the needed properties to have a valid asset. The image then only needs to save special properties like the image files and its display sizes.
All assets have a list of tags that are associated in a many to many relationship which means that a tag can get belong to many assets and assets are able to reference many tags. Tags are used in the search (see salon#pages#search).
