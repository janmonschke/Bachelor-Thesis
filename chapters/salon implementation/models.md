### Model structure
The underlying data model of Salon is shown in Fig. 2. There is the User class that is used for authentication and it has properties like a username and a password. The Page class is associated to the User class in a one-to-many relationship, which means that instances of User can reference many instances of Page and each instance of Page belongs to only one instance of User. Pages have properties like a title, a cover image and a publish state. Each Page has a list of Assets that are also associated in a one-to-many relationship so that each Asset can be associated to one Page. The Asset class is the parent class for Image and it stores properties like a title, a link-to location and a position on the canvas.
The reason for inheriting the Image class from the Asset class is to allow other Assets, like for example texts, in the future (see I 4. "Quo vadis Salon?") and to provide all instances of Image with the needed properties that make up a valid Asset. The Image class then only needs to save properties like the image files and its display sizes.
All Asset instances have a list of Tags that are associated in a many-to-many relationship which means that an instance of Tag can belong to many instances of Asset and each instance of Asset is able to reference many instances of Tag. The Tag class is used in the search (see I 3.3.9 "Search") and only stores a title and the associations.
