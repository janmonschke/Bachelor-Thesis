### Technology
The backend of Salon is implemented in Ruby on Rails (short Rails), a web framework written in Ruby (http://rubyonrails.org/) and modeled after the MVC software pattern (http://betterexplained.com/articles/intermediate-rails-understanding-models-views-and-controllers/) that allows to quickly create solid web applications without having to care about low-level problems like session-handling or database access. The underlying database is MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/), a document-oriented database system that was chosen because of its flexibility (document-oriented databases are schema free(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database)) and its very good integration in Rails.
Salon does not make use of the frontend tools of Rails because the frontend is designed to work as a Single Page Web App (SPWA) and therefore all Rails frontend tools have been replaced with tools that are written in JavaScript so that they could get executed in the browser (see SPWA#intro).
The communication between the frontend and the backend is realized with a REST(http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) interface and all data is being sent in the JSON (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation) format, a format that is very easy to use in both JavaScript (frontend) and Ruby (backend).
