- Make whole thing as a SPWA with Hakim's Slide Framework
  - Don't say that at the start
  - Reveal it when talking about SPWAs and that they want to make websites feel more like native Apps
  - "Who would've guessed that the slides that I am currently showing are only a website?" -> BÃ„MM-effect...At least I hope so...

- Q: What to show first?
  - a: introduction to SPWAs?
  - b: introduction to Salon?
  - decision: b first because to keep this presentation in the same structure as the thesis
